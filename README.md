### Current Status: 
- rev3 pcb scheduled to be prototyped 
- rev3 case was printed, however not completely satisfied with the look (I'm bad at designing keyboards)

## Endeavour V³ released //
The third iteration introduced a complete redesign of the pcb primarily to accommodate the **RP2040** and **BAV70 diodes**. I tried creating a circular positioning pattern for the components where their center is set with the mcu itself. Due to reposition of every component I rerouted the whole board again; also because Endeavour V¹ was one of my first designs and you can tell it was. A new silkscreen for both front and back of the pcb sets a different theme and clutters the whole board with ASCII-rubbish. This came into my mind because any actual drawing or pattern idea I had was blocked by my miserable ability to create art.
A new **case** accompanies this revision. Its not entirely done neither am I satisfied with its look and design. My abilities with CAD are limited and I lack the endurance ( will to use Windows or learn an alternative software) and time to make a better one or to create an actual good / decent design. 
Nevertheless my current process is shared in [this folder](/rev3/3dp_case/).
I've **tested the case** with a previous rev pcb and could verify that its mostly working. 
The new **case utilizes tadpole mount** of some sort hence I **ought to write a build guide**. 

For the previous versions of the **PCB** and **Case** look at the folders below:

1. [Rev1](/rev1/rev1.md)
2. [Rev2](/rev2/rev2.md)

### Features |- Rev3:
- support for two encoders ( top left)(bottom row middle)
- RP2040 
- 3 IO Pins exposed via breakout 
- pinout for led-strip (WS28 and similarly supported)
- QMK / VIAL support
- different layout options
- new **case** with tadpole mount


#### Layout:

## Images 

### Images of V³ PCB:
I will post them once I have ordered and tested the new pcbs. 
This will likely be in **November**.

### Images of V³ case:
Those are only renders, however I've printed a small test version already.
